To start the project
    yarn
    yarn start

Explanation:
* I dont need to setup redux for this small project. Instead, I used context-api to store global state data
* I used material ui
* Generaly I prefer semi-atomic design but for this project I never write atoms-molecules-organism for fast-coding.
